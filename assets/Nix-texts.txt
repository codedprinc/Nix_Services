        </ul>
        <h3><b>DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM(DMS)</b></h3>
        <p>Document management is one of the oldest methods of managing the ever growing amount of organization data, be it permanent or temporary company data. Sometimes back we used to store the data in bound form but this proved to be tricky in the sense that getting electronic copies of the same became slightly difficult. In the advent of technology we have embraced modern modes of data storage not withstanding the fact that we still need to store the scanned documents in bound form so as to avoid loss and displacement, also minimize on the storage space required. The bound data is organized in serialized form to be a reflection of the scanned data hence ease in access for both.
            We as an organization realized that most of the scanned documents which initially had running order would not reflect the same when we secured the binding contracts hence we had to sort and run the documents again to enable smooth operation during binding process. These experiences  made us venture into scanning as a preceeding process to binding and follow the whole process to conclusion, conclusion being archival of the bound document.</p>
        <p><i>The process is as follows:</i></p>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>Sorting of documents</li>
            <li>Listing of documents</li>
            <li>Arrangement of documents</li>
            <li>Scanning and data capture</li>
            <li>Indexing of the documents</li>
            <li>Processing of the data</li>
            <li>Data storage in either servers or cloud</li>
            <li>Training of staff on the usage and accessibility of stored data</li>
            <li>Binding of the scanned documents</li>
            <li>Labelling of bound documents</li>
            <li>Setting of the archive</li>
            <li>Archival of the documents into shelves</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The above process is cost effective and very efficient. In our observation over time, space, money and even the health implications that arise form scavenging for company data among heaps and piles of age old but still very essential data run into millions of shillings, also lost man hours and even business opportunities there in were enormous and un-imaginable.  </p>
        <p>the main benefits of this process are:
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>Reduced storage</li>            <li>Improved, faster and more flexible search.</li>
            <li>Flexible retrieval</li>         <li>Controlled and improved document distribution</li>
            <li>Flexible indexing</li>          <li>Improved regulatory</li>
            <li>Improved security</li>          <li>Improved Internal operations</li>
            <li>Disaster recovery</li>          <li>Improved Customer Service and satisfaction</li>
            <li>No lost files</li>              <li>Preserve Intellectual Capital- Organizational Knowledge</li>
            <li>Digital archiving</li>          <li>Improved Cash flow</li>
            <li>Competitive edge</li>           <li>Box files can be re-used to collect data.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>For instance when you take box file stacked in shelves they gather a lot of dust unlike a book that is bound and compact, bearing in mind that the documents of the same caliber in 5 box files can be bound into 10 books and occupy a space of half the number of five box files. Once the box files are emptied they can be recycled for use at a later date.
            In essence what we are saying when the documents are archived you accrue benefits in more than one area, we are talking of time, space, money and easy access to company data, just a click away.</p>
